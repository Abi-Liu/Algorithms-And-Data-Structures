# Algorithms-And-Data-Structures
This repository contains a collection of LeetCode problems that I have completed in JavaScript that implement various data structures and algorithms. The problems are organized by topic and include detailed explanations to help you understand how they work.

Feel free to fork this repo and implement your own solutions for the problems, or to look at my notes if you get stuck on a specific problem.

## Requirements

NPM is required to run the test code provided in this repository. If you don't have that installed, you can install it by following the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once you have that installed, the only dependency we will need is Jest to run the unit tests.

## Running the Examples

To get this running on your local machine, first fork and clone this repository. Once you have your own copy cloned onto your local machine, be sure to install the dependencies with the command `npm i` to be able to run the unit tests.

This repository is organized into distinct algorithm implementations, each contained in its own subdirectory. These subdirectories provide the source code, and unit tests files necessary for each algorithm. You can run all of the unit tests with the command `npm test` or a single test file by including the path for the problem you want to test: `npm test src/Hash/GroupAnagrams/solution.test.js`

## Topics

You can find the full list of problems [here](https://github.com/Abi-Liu/Algorithms-And-Data-Structures/blob/main/src/ProblemList.md).

I recommend going through the problems list in order as each topic builds upon the previous ones.
